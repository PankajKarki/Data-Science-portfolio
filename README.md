		- [MLB Housing Market EDA and Regression](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/MLB%20Housing%20Market%20EDA%20and%20Regression.ipynb): The objective of this project is to apply exploratory analysis and regression techniques to identify which features affect home prices the most in the Melbourne Housing Market.
	- __R__ 
		- [Exploratory Data Analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369090): Exploratory analysis of the BRFSS-2013 data set, focusing on investigating the relationship between education and eating habits, sleep and mental health, and smoking, drinking and general health of a person. 
		- [Inference Statistics with GSS data](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369261) : Using the GSS (General Social Survey) dataset to infer if, in the year 2012, were men, of 18 years or above in the United States, more likely to oppose sex education in public schools than women.
		- [Data Visualization: Human Development and Corruption](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369270): A scatter plot for the relationship between the 'Human Development Index' and the 'Corruption Perceptions Index' of countries.
		- [Moneyball: Analysing and replacing lost players](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369305): Exploration of baseball data for the year 2001 to look at replacements for key players lost by the Oakland A's in 2001. Inspired by the book/movie: Moneyball.
                
                
- ### Micro Projects:

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): We will create a logistic regression model that will predict whether or not a user will click on an ad, based on his/her features. 
		- [Retrieving Wikipedia articles](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/Document%20Retrival%20System.ipynb): In this project, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF.
		- [Song Recommender System](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/Song%20Recommender%20System.ipynb): This project is for recommending songs, which compared the simple popularity-based recommendation with a personalized model, and showed the significant improvement provided by personalization.
		- [Malware Detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/Malware%20Detection%20Classification.ipynb): To classify wheather a file is malicious or not using machine learning techniques.
		

	- __R__
		- [Comparison between traditional statistical modeling and ML techniques](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369094):  I am interested to learn how well can I predict whether an individualâ€™s annual income exceeds $50,000 using the set of variables in this data set. The question is inspected in two different approaches - traditional statistical modeling and machine learning techniques. 
		- [ML Classification: Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369264): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public.
        

- ### Workshop:
	- __Python__
		- [Apparel Recommendation Engine Workshop](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369094):  In this workshop, I have build a recommendation engine which suggests similar products to the given product in any e-commerce websites ex. Amazon.com, myntra.com etc.
