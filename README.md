# Data-Science-portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

#### The R portfolio is located [here](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786).

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- __R__ 
		- [Exploratory Data Analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369090): Exploratory analysis of the BRFSS-2013 data set, focusing on investigating the relationship between education and eating habits, sleep and mental health, and smoking, drinking and general health of a person. 
		- [Inference Statistics with GSS data](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369261) : Using the GSS (General Social Survey) dataset to infer if, in the year 2012, were men, of 18 years or above in the United States, more likely to oppose sex education in public schools than women.
		- [Data Visualization: Human Development and Corruption](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369270): A scatter plot for the relationship between the 'Human Development Index' and the 'Corruption Perceptions Index' of countries.
		- [Moneyball: Analysing and replacing lost players](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369305): Exploration of baseball data for the year 2001 to look at replacements for key players lost by the Oakland A's in 2001. Inspired by the book/movie: Moneyball.
                
                
- ### Micro Projects:

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Data-Science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): We will create a logistic regression model that will predict whether or not a user will click on an ad, based on his/her features. 
		

	- __R__
		- [Comparison between traditional statistical modeling and ML techniques](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369094):  I am interested to learn how well can I predict whether an individualâ€™s annual income exceeds $50,000 using the set of variables in this data set. The question is inspected in two different approaches - traditional statistical modeling and machine learning techniques. 
		- [ML Classification: Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369264): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public.
        

- ### Workshop:
	- __Python__
		- [Apparel Recommendation Engine Workshop](https://rpubs.com/Pankajkarki786/369094):  In this workshop, I have build a recommendation engine which suggests similar products to the given product in any e-commerce websites ex. Amazon.com, myntra.com etc.
